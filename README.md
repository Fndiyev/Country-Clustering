- Exploratory data analysis and visualization with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Clustering using:
  - **KMeans**
  - **Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering**
- Dimensionality reduction with **PCA**
- Cluster validation using **Silhouette Score**

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`Country-data.csv`) contains various numerical features such as:
- Income
- Health
